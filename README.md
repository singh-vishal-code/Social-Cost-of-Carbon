# Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) – Methods and Policy Implications

**Overview**
This project explores the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), an economic measure that estimates the monetary value of damages caused by emitting one additional metric ton of CO₂. It highlights the methodology, U.S. policy evolution, and implications for India.

The study examines:
Calculation steps for SCC
Role of discount rates
Policy usage in the U.S. under different administrations
Applicability and challenges for India
Comparison with mitigation cost analysis

**Methodology – Steps for Calculating SCC**
Project future emissions
Model future climate responses
Assess climate impacts (health, agriculture, floods, etc.)
Convert damages into present-day values
Example: If SCC = $51/ton CO₂, a plant emitting 1M tons annually causes $51M in future damages.

**Policy Implications**

U.S. Experience
Obama (2009–2016): Formal adoption, SCC ≈ $41/tCO₂
Trump (2017–2020): Reduced SCC ($1–7/tCO₂), ignored global impacts
Biden (2021–2024): Reinstated IWG, Interim SCC = $51/tCO₂; EPA later proposed $190/tCO₂
Trump (2025–Present): Discontinued SCC unless legally required

Indian Context
India: 3rd largest emitter, but low per capita emissions
Estimates: US$2.9/tCO₂ (2015, Economic Survey) vs. US$80–130/tCO₂ (NBER)
Applications: Policy appraisal, carbon pricing, targeted incentives
Challenges: Coal reliance, economic constraints, affordability concerns

**SCC vs. Mitigation Cost Analysis**
SCC: Values avoided damages (benefit side).
Mitigation Cost Analysis: Estimates expenses of emission cuts (cost side).
Conclusion: They are complementary, forming a complete cost–benefit framework.

**Key Takeaways**
SCC is a crucial tool for climate policy and economic decision-making.
Policy shifts in the U.S. demonstrate its political sensitivity.
For India, SCC offers guidance but needs context-specific adaptation.
Effective climate policy requires balancing benefits (SCC) and costs (mitigation analysis).
